# SB DBA
Default working version is for M1 Mac - Arm architecture, how to use in amd64 architecture is under.
### Description
Playbooks that contain "provision" are only for setting up VM-s with Vagrant. Playbooks that are in separate folder named playbooks are used in actual ansibleserver. 
There are 2 playbooks in playbooks folder - 1 for database server and 1 for application server. These are copied to ansibleserver while provision with vagrant.
The desired file for this project gathered_data.csv is different when building from scratch. Because I used random generated data for dummy data.
